# Eco-Car
perform a machine learning technique to predict the car velocity distribution along a round track. 
Using the readings from a home-made speed sensors and a servo to control the car throttle, 
the collected data analyzed on Matlab by Linear regression code.

The car participated in Shell Eco-marathon.
Shell Eco-marathon challenges engineering student teams from around the world to design, build and test ultra-energy-efficient vehicles.
As a member in Cairo University Team:
   we got The 4th place in shell eco-marathon Asia for the gasoline urban concept category.
